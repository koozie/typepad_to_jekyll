<p>I put in <a href="http://www.linksys.com/Products/product.asp?grid=33&scid=35&prid=508">Linksys wireless router/access point</a> on my home network one week ago.  I quickly configured the router using its web based configuration tool.  I've also been able to get a descent signal ALL over the house.</p>

<p>Wireless is just plain cool.  I can't believe I waited so long to use it.  </p>

Yeah, wireless is the way to go. Mrs. Noded has here own laptop. It makes it so much easier. Here, there and everywhere. 

You posting from the backyard?

It's to freaking HOT here to be outside longer than 5 minutes.  We had tempeartures up to 108 degrees.  Maybe I'll try the outside thing this fall.

Just wait until your wireless access point dies (just like mine did this week) and then you REALLY realise how much you thought of it. I got good coverage all over the house and the garden. Now I'm stuck to sitting in the office tied by a long piece of cat5 cable :-(

Before I had wireless, I connected two 25' cat5 cables together so I could work in the living room instead of the office. :-)

I had something similar - a LONG piece of cable through a hole drilled in the ceiling from the upstairs office into the living room and then coiled in a big loop so it would reach anywhere downstairs if stretched across the room....that changed when I got married :-)
